# BitGo-utxo with Komodo Antara (Cryptoconditions) Support

A fork from BitGo javascript library [bitgo-utxo-lib](https://github.com/bitgo/bitgo-utxo-lib).<br>
A javascript Bitcoin library for node.js and browsers. Written mostly in javascript, with the cryptoconditions (cc) library written in rust and built as a wasm module.<br>
Added support for komodo messages including nSPV protocol and cc features along with the cryptoconditions lib (as a wasm module).<br>
Komodo Antara (Cryptoconditions, CC) technology allows to create complex multisignature transactions and add custom consensus code to komodo based assets chains.<br>
This javascript library allows to develop SPV clients using Antara (CC) technology.<br>
More info: [Antara Development Docs](http://developers.komodoplatform.com/basic-docs/antara/introduction-to-antara.html)<br>

Released under the terms of the [MIT LICENSE](https://github.com/dimxy/bitgo-komodo-cc-lib/blob/master/LICENSE).

## Prerequisites

You need installed:
  - nodejs v.12+<br>
  - rust and<br>
  - wasm-pack, both to build wasm cryptoconditions module<br> 
  
If you are going to use this lib in browser you also need:
  - browserify package<br> 
  - a webserver app (for example, webpack dev server)<br>
  - a wsproxy app (for example, webcoin-bridge)

## What test app does

Included a ccfaucetpoc.js file that allows to create cc faucet create and get transactions.<br>
To test this you need a komodod chain with cc modules enabled (Note about the correct komodod repo with an nspv patch, see below)

## Installation

Clone this git repository go to the new dir and checkout dev-kmd branch.

Install the bitgo-komodo-cc-lib dependency packages, inside the repo dir run:

```
npm install
```

You'll need a komodo test asset chain to run the ccfaucetpoc sample.
Setup network parameters for your komodo chain:<br>
Open `networks.js` and make a new entry for your chain. You need to fix the 'YOURCHAINNAME' and 'magic' params for your chain, like:
```
module.exports = {
  YOURCHAINNAME: {
    messagePrefix: '\xYourChainName asset chain:\n',
    bech32: 'R',
    bip32: getDefaultBip32Mainnet(),   
    pubKeyHash: 0x3c,
    scriptHash: 0x55,
    cryptoconditionHash: 0x1c,
    wif: 0xbc,
    consensusBranchId: {
      1: 0x00,
      2: 0x00,
      3: 0x5ba81b19,
      4: 0x76b809bb // (Sapling branch id used in kmd)
    },
    coin: coins.ZEC,
    komodoAssetNet: true,
    magic: 0x12345678  // komodo chain magic, obtain with getinfo rpc
    // to connect over p2p:
    dnsSeeds: [ 
      'yourdomain.org:12345'
    ],
    staticPeers: [
      '192.168.123.123:12345'
    ],
    // to connect over websockets:
    webSeeds: [
      //'ws://192.168.123.123:54321'
    ],
  },
};
```

In ccfaucetpoc.js source change mynetwork var to some yourchainname:<br>
```
var mynetwork=networks.YOURCHAINNAME
```

Set your funding faucet wif and address and a wif and address getting funds in ccfaucetpoc.js (set vars faucetcreatewif, faucetcreateaddress, faucetgetwif, faucetgetaddress).<br>

## Build test app to run in nodejs

Build the cryptoconditions wasm module:<br>
Setup the rust nightly build to build cryptoconditions:
```
rustup toolchain install nightly
rustup default nightly
```

Change to cryptoconditions-js directory and build the cryptoconditions wasm module for nodejs target:
```
cd ./node_modules/cryptoconditions-js
wasm-pack build -t nodejs
```

Run the testapp in nodejs:
```
node ./ccfaucetpoc.js
```

## How to use the test app in the browser:

To run the test app in the browser you will need a webserver to host an html sample page and the test app ccfaucetpocbr.js.
Also you need a websocket proxy to convert websockets into nspv p2p protocol.

### Setting up a web server

I use the webpack dev server running in nodejs.<br>
To setup a webpack sample config make a dir like 'webpack' and create inside it two files with the following content:

package.json:
```
{
  "scripts": {
    "serve": "webpack-dev-server"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "cryptoconditions-js": "git+https://github.com/dimxy/cryptoconditions-js.git#master"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "webpack": "^4.44.2",
    "webpack-cli": "^3.3.12",
    "webpack-dev-server": "^3.11.0"
  }
}
```

webpack.config.js:
```
const path = require('path');
module.exports = {
  entry: "./ccfaucetpocbr.js",
  output: {
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, "dist"),
    filename: "ccfaucetpocbr-bundle.js",
    library: 'myLibrary'
  },
  mode: "development",
  //to serve from any external address (do not add this devServer config to serve only locally):
  devServer: {
    port: 8080,
    host: '0.0.0.0'
  }
};
```
(Both those package.json and webpack.config.js files may be found in webpack-test subdir of bitgo-komodo-cc-lib dir)
Inside the webpack dir run: 
```
npm install
``` 
(ignore printed errors)

Set again the nightly rust version for this repo:
```
rustup default nightly
```

Change to ./node_modules/cryptoconditions-js subdir and run the following command to build cryptoconditions lib wasm (for use with browserify tool):
```
cd ./node_modules/cryptoconditions-js
wasm-pack build
```
Note that if you use npm [@tokel](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@tokel/cryptoconditions-js) version of the cryptocondition-js lib you do not need to build it, it is already precompiled.

Now go to bitgo-komodo-cc-lib repo dir.<br>
Build the test app for browser:
```
browserify ./samples/ccfaucetpoc.js --standalone faucet -o ccfaucetpocbr.js
```
Copy created ccfaucetpocbr.js into your webpack dir.
Copy the example of an index.html page from the webpack-test dir to your webpack dir.
Inside your webpack dir run the web server with a command:
```
npm run serve
```
The web server should be available at http://localhost:8080 url (if you installed the webpack on the same PC).


### Use the correct komodod version

The last thing is to make sure you run a komodod version with an extension to nSPV getutxos call (it should additionally return script for each utxo).<br>
Use this komodod branch for this:
https://github.com/dimxy/komodo/tree/nspv-utxo-ext

I recommed to run komodod with -debug=net to easily discover wrong magic errors and observe communication dynamic. Basically komodod should print ver/verack and ping/pong exchanges in the debug.log, if connection is okay


## What should happen in the test

When you run the chain, webpack and webcoin-bridge, you might go to the test page url in browser (http://localhost:8080).<br>
It allows first to connect to a peer and then create cc faucet transactions. 


## Info about new and updated packages

Some dependent packages were modified to add support for komodo:
  * bitcoin-protocol

Links to these packages in package.json are updated to load them from forked github repositories (see package.json).  
  
Also added a new package cryptoconditions-js link that currently is loaded from a github repo.
